# Usage: run_test.sh <setup script> <work dir> [emulator...] <test executable>
#
# Runs the optional setup script to build a scratch image in <work dir>, then
# runs the test executable with the image path as its first argument.
#
# If a check script exists next to the setup script (test_<name>.check.sh),
# it runs after the test succeeded, on the host, with the image path as $1.
# It verifies what lwext4 wrote with independent tools (e2fsck, debugfs);
# common/check.sh has helpers for that.
